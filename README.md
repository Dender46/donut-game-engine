## What is this? ü§®
My own small engine with which you can create simple games. 
<br/><br/>

## But why? ü§î
It's goal is not to make commercial profit, but rather learn new tech, explore new problems and solutions, probably make games with them. It only will be for education purpose.
<br/><br/>

## Okay, tell me more ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Well, right now (as of writing this README) everything is:
* Rendered via OpenGL;
* Uses Box2D as physics library;
* Uses FreeType as text rendering library;
* Uses ImGui as library for GUI;
<br/><br/>

In the future I will attempt adapting engine for platforms MacOS, Linux, cause right now is only Windows is supported. Also supporting diffent rendering API would be awesome.
